            <h1>Research Being Done</h1>
            <h3>Brain Aneurysm Foundation</h3>
            <p>They have funded nearly $5.5 million to date towards brain aneurysm research in the US and Canada.
                <br>They focus their research on making early detection better and advancing treatment methods further. Their goal is for better outcomes for their patients.
                <br>Their goal is to be able to identify aneurysms before they rupture, hopefully preventing many fatal strokes down the line.

            <h3>University of Pittsburgh</h3>
            <p>The Stroke Institute is made up of stroke-focused inpatient services offered at UPMC Presbyterian, UPMC Mercy, and UPMC Shadyside.
                <br>NIH StrokeNet is a group of clinical research trials, being conducted since 2013. Over 400 hospitals have contributed to these trials.
            </p>
            <h3>National Science Foundation</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project is to advance the scientific study of brain functional changes after a stroke and pioneer a tailored rehabilitation strategy that fits each individual.
                <br>It seeks to combine different imaging methods to guide electrical stimulation to the brain that improves the recovery of movement.
                <br>This project will address this limitation and establish a unique rehabilitation engineering research paradigm based on a novel multi-modal<br>
                brain imaging approach and a closed-loop high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) platform. This new approach will precisely<br>
                assess the changes to motor control in an injured brain and identify the key network to target for more precise HD-tDCS stimulation

            <br><h1>Types of strokes</h1>
            <p>There are two main types of strokes, <b>ischemic</b> and <b>hemorrhagic</b>. <br>An ischemic
            stroke occurs due to a blocked blood vessel, either from a clot or the buildup of a fatty substance
            called plaque. These are the most common types of strokes seen. <br>A hemorrhagic strokes are a 
            result of a blood vessel bursting or leaking in the brain. </p>
            
            <br><h1>FAQs</h1>
            <h3>1. What does it look like when someone is having a stroke?</h3>
            <p>Here are some main signs you can look for using the acronym BEFAST:<br>
                <ul>
                    <br> <b>B: Balance</b> - Sudden trouble or loss of balance or corrdination <br>
                    <br> <b>E: Eyes</b> - Sudden blurred or double vision or a loss of vision in one or both eyes without pain <br>
                    <br> <b>F: Face Drooping</b> - One side of the face is dropping or numb when smiling <br>
                    <br> <b>A: Arm Weakness</b> - One arm is weak or numb. May drift downwards when arm is raised.<br>
                    <br> <b>S: Speech Difficulty</b> - Slurred speech, unable to speak, or difficulty saying simple phrases. <br>
                    <br> <b>T: Time to call 911</b> - If a person you know shows any of these symptoms, call 911 immediatly.<br>
                        Even if any of the symptoms go away, they still could be having a stroke or have already had one.
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br><h3>2. Does it matter what age you are?</h3>
            <p>A persons risk of having a stroke does increase with age, however it can happen at any time.</p>
            <br><h3>3. What are conditions that can increase the likleyhood of having a stroke?</h3>
            <p>Previous conditions such as having a stroke in the past, high blood pressure, heart disease, <br>
                high cholesterol, diabeties, sickle cell disease, obesity, and having a family history of strokes<br>
                can all put someone at higher risk of having a stroke.
            </p>
            <br><h3>4. What can I do if someone I know is having a stroke?</h3>
            <p>If you notice someone showing any of the B.E.F.A.S.T. signs, call 911 immediatly. Also, take note<br>
            of when they first started showing symptoms and tell the EMT or nurse. Don't give them food, water, or<br>
            medicine. You don't know what kind of stroke they had and it could affect their ability to swallow. </p><br>
