        <h3>About the book</h3>
        <p>When a stroke leaves Jenn comatose and clinging to life just days before her thirty-<br>
            first birthday, she and her family face an overwhelming and painful journey. As they<br>
            struggle to grasp what happened, to move forward and heal, they discover an <br>
            unexpected gift: how to be present in times of uncertainty while holding onto hope<br>
            and the power of family and community to sustain them through these challenging times.
        <br><br>Structured as diary entries, this poignant memoir shares memories from each family<br>
            member as they walk together through this profoundly life-changing event, grapple<br>
            with grief, and learn to look for silver linings: gratitude, intentional time together, and<br>
            the closeness of family and friends to help them heal.  Even before her stroke these<br>
            values were ingrained in Jenn. She was a motivational speaker on wellness and self-<br>
            care, created her own content, and taught a six-week course called “Lead Your Life.”
        <br><br>Currently, she and her family share a very personal and intimate time of their lives in<br>
            the hope that those who are struggling with similar experiences of loss and change<br>
            will find connection, solace, and the courage to overcome even the greatest challenges.</p>
