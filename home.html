            <h1>About The Book</h1>
            <p>
                When a stroke leaves Jenn comatose and clinging to life just days before her thirty-first birthday, she and her family face an overwhelming and painful journey. As they struggle to grasp what happened, to move forward and heal, they discover an unexpected gift: how to be present in times of uncertainty while holding onto hope and the power of family and community to sustain them through these challenging times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Structured as diary entries, this poignant memoir shares memories from each family member as they walk together through this profoundly life-changing event, grapple with grief, and learn to look for silver linings: gratitude, intentional time together, and the closeness of family and friends to help them heal.  Even before her stroke these values were ingrained in Jenn. She was a motivational speaker on wellness and self-care, created her own content, and taught a six-week course called "Lead Your Life."
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, she and her family share a very personal and intimate time of their lives in the hope that those who are struggling with similar experiences of loss and change will find connection, solace, and the courage to overcome even the greatest challenges.
            </p>
            <h1>What is a Stroke?</h1>
            <p>
                A stroke is a serious neurological condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, often due to blocked or burst blood vessels. As these vessels clog and sometimes rupture, the brain is suddenly deprived of oxygen and nutrients, causing the rapid death of brain cells. Globally, strokes are a leading cause of disability and rank as the second deadliest condition. While a definitive cure remains elusive, scientists are making promising strides. Cutting-edge stroke therapies aim to restore blood flow to the brain, offering hope for better outcomes and improved recovery.
