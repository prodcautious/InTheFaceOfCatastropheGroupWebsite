        <h1>Praise</h1>
        <p>"Terrifying and uplifting by turns, In the Face of Catastrophe is a memoir <br>
            about the everyday suffering and silver linings discovered while working <br>
            through a health crisis with family members to assist. This idea of presence<br>
            as a gift is the book’s most tangible and inspiring quality." ~ Foreword Clarion
        <br><br>
        "In the Face of Catastrophe alternates between understandable despair and hopeful<br>
        bromides, lessons, and insights from the experience, especially on embracing the<br>
        power of presence in the everyday. Goldman’s journey toward recovery is heartening,<br>
        and the family’s accounts will offer comfort to others facing similar trials." ~ Publishers weekly booklife
        <br><br>
        "Goldman and Hirschleifer deserve plaudits for this one-of-a-kind offering that will<br>
        be a powerful inspiration to those who struggle with health crises without assistance." ~ Readers favorite
        <br><br>
        "A beautiful, exhilarating account of gratitude and resilience, and how one family<br>
        faced catastrophe and found unexpected blessings. A story of stoicism through unimaginable <br>
        crisis. Anyone wondering how they’ll overcome even the darkest challenge will find light in <br>
        these fast-turning pages." ~ Steve Israel
        <br><br>
        "It’s easy to lose hope when a friend or loved one struggles with a serious medical condition <br>
        or becomes critically ill. Jennifer Goldman and Caryn Hirshleifer, in their book, In the Face <br>
        of Catastrophe, tell us how they remained positive when faced with a devastating loss. Their <br>
        heartwarming story encourages us all to keep fighting to overcome the odds and provides hope <br>
        to all who need it. Miracles can happen. And they do. I recommend this book to my constituents <br>
        and friends who are facing difficult times." ~ Paul Feiner
        <br><br>
        "This is an inspiring story of recovery and renewal against the odds. It teaches us how the power <br>
        of family and community can carry us through life’s toughest times and greatest challenges." ~ LL Cool Jay</p>
