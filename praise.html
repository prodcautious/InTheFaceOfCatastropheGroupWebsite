            <div class="quotes">
                <p>"Terrifying and uplifting by turns, In the Face of Catastrophe is a memoir
                    about the everyday suffering and silver linings discovered while working 
                    through a health crisis with family members to assist. This idea of presence
                    as a gift is the book’s most tangible and inspiring quality."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "In the Face of Catastrophe alternates between understandable despair and hopeful
                    bromides, lessons, and insights from the experience, especially on embracing the
                    power of presence in the everyday. Goldman’s journey toward recovery is heartening,
                    and the family’s accounts will offer comfort to others facing similar trials."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Goldman and Hirschleifer deserve plaudits for this one-of-a-kind offering that will
                    be a powerful inspiration to those who struggle with health crises without assistance."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "A beautiful, exhilarating account of gratitude and resilience, and how one family
                    faced catastrophe and found unexpected blessings. A story of stoicism through unimaginable
                    crisis. Anyone wondering how they’ll overcome even the darkest challenge will find light in
                    these fast-turning pages."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "It’s easy to lose hope when a friend or loved one struggles with a serious medical condition 
                    or becomes critically ill. Jennifer Goldman and Caryn Hirshleifer, in their book, In the Face 
                    of Catastrophe, tell us how they remained positive when faced with a devastating loss. Their 
                    heartwarming story encourages us all to keep fighting to overcome the odds and provides hope 
                    to all who need it. Miracles can happen. And they do. I recommend this book to my constituents
                    and friends who are facing difficult times."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "This is an inspiring story of recovery and renewal against the odds. It teaches us how the power
                    of family and community can carry us through life’s toughest times and greatest challenges."
