                        or becomes critically ill. Jennifer Goldman and Caryn Hirshleifer, in their book, In the Face 
                        of Catastrophe, tell us how they remained positive when faced with a devastating loss. Their 
                        heartwarming story encourages us all to keep fighting to overcome the odds and provides hope 
                        to all who need it. Miracles can happen. And they do. I recommend this book to my constituents
                        and friends who are facing difficult times."
