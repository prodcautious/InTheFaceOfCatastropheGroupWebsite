                    Before her stroke, Jennifer Rose Goldman, a 2013 graduate of Skidmore College with a joint degree in religion and philosophy, founded and served as CEO of Essential Rose, 
                    an aromatherapy beauty brand that she started in her college dormitory room. Essential Rose packaged and sold teas and skin-care products for inner, rather than outer, beauty. 
                    A motivational speaker on wellness and self-care, she created her own content and taught a six-week course called “Lead Your Life.” Jenn is passionate about all things spiritual and loves discovering any new modalities she can immerse herself in.

                <h3>Amanda Gwen Goldman</h3>
                <p>
                    Amanda Gwen Goldman, younger sister of Jenn and daughter of Caryn, has a passion for mixing colors and integrating textural elements into her drawings. 
                    The book illustrations are complex and gritty and speak to the dialectic between the beauty and lightness of her color presentation as contrasted with the 
                    rugged texture reflecting the heaviness under which the illustrations were conceived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amanda also loves the artistry of fashion and is dedicated to finding justice and would ultimately like to help falsely incarcerated prisoners.
